	Deep in the forest there lives a squirrel named Robert. Robert lived a normal squirrel life collecting and hiding acorns until one day when disaster struck. All of Robertâ€™s favorite acorn trees had disappeared. 

        As Robert looked around in confusion, he spotted a mischevious looking hooligan standing in the distance. Robert approached the figure and asked "Who are you, and do you what happened to all of the trees, and the acorns inside? The figure replied with a shady look in his eye "My name's Erik, and haven't you heard? The trees grew legs, and walked away." "That's absurd!" Robert proclaimed, "now show me my acorns Erik, if that is your real name."
