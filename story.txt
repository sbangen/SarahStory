	Deep in the forest there lives a squirrel named Robert. Robert lived a normal squirrel life collecting and hiding acorns until one day when disaster struck. All of Robertâ€™s favorite acorn trees had disappeared. 

        As Robert looked around in confusion, he spotted a mischevious looking hooligan standing in the distance. Robert approached the figure and asked "Who are you, and do you know what happened to all of the trees, and the acorns inside? The figure replied with a shady look in his eye "My name's Erik, and haven't you heard? The trees grew legs, and walked away." "That's absurd!" Robert proclaimed, "now show me my acorns Erik, if that is your real name."


"Acorns? AcOrNs? ACORNS?", Erik violently proclaimed, "YOU THINK THIS IS ABOUT ACORNS?". Robert began to back up in fear. "THIS IS ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN ACORNS. "GIVE ME MY ACORNS" shouted robert after regaining confidence in a sort of mental second wind. "DONT MAKE ME DO IT", screamed Erik. "I'LL DO IT FIRST", returned Robert as he took out a glowing blue jar from his squirrish pockets. "CHUG JUG CHUG JUG", the surrounding wildlife begane to chant. Robert drank the chug jug and doubled in size and power. The battle has just begun.

	No sooner had Robert grown to gigantic (for a squirrel) size, than the so-called "Erik" called out "I speak for the trees...Boo-ra-room! You will leave my Acorn flock be!" They battled fiercely, scattering forest creatures and fantasty tropes where the forest had once been. Neither seemed to be able to get the upper hand.
